# Create four classes:
# >A with a method show(),
# >B and C that inherit from A and override show(),
# >D that inherits from both B and C.
# Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.

class A:
    def show(self):
        return "Method from class A"

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        return "Method from class B"

class C(A):
    def show(self):

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
